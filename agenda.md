### Agenda
The main goal of this course is to get users up and running with Python in a hands-on approach. Not much theory, practical knowledge is praised. This course is oriented towards experienced programmers and is aiming for learning Python syntax and environment in a comfortable manner then diving into "pythonic" way of doing stuff which is extremely useful once mastered.
